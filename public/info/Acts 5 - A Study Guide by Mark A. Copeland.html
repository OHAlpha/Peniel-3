                              Chapter Five</b>

<b>OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS CHAPTER</b>

1) To examine the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in lying to the Holy
   Spirit

2) To note the amazing signs and wonders that were done by the apostles,
   in which all were healed

3) To consider the apostles' response when government seeks to stifle
   the preaching of the gospel

<b>SUMMARY</b>

In contrast to the remarkable liberality in the church as described in
the previous chapter, we are now told of the example of Ananias and
Sapphira.  A husband and wife who sold a possession, they tried to
mislead the apostles that they were giving the entire proceeds.
Confronted one at a time by Peter and found guilty of lying against the
Holy Spirit, they both fall dead, bringing great fear upon all (<b>1-11</b>).

Highly esteemed among the people, the apostles continue doing many signs
and wonders among the people and in the temple (Solomon's Porch).
Believers were added to the Lord in increasing numbers, who then brought
the sick out into the streets on beds and couches, that perhaps the
shadow of Peter might fall on some of them.  A multitude from the
surrounding cities brought those who were sick and tormented, and
everyone was healed (<b>12-16</b>).

Once again the high priest and those of Sadducees are filled with anger.
They have the apostles placed into custody.  During the night, an angel
of the Lord frees them and commands the apostles to continue to teach in
the temple.  In the morning when the council convenes, the prison is
found secure but empty.  When told that the apostles are teaching in the
temple, officers are sent to bring the apostles peacefully to the
council.  When the high priest charges them of disobeying the command
not to teach in the name of Jesus (cf. <b>4:18</b>), the apostles reply "We
ought to obey God rather than man."  They further proclaim that God
raised Jesus (whom the council had murdered) and has exalted Him to be
Prince and Savior who offers repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
sins.  To this the apostles claim to be witnesses, along with the Holy
Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him (<b>17-32</b>).

Infuriated, the council plots to kill the apostles.  However, one in the
council, a Pharisee and highly respected teacher of the law by the name
of Gamaliel (cf. <b>22:3</b>), advises the council to leave the apostles alone.
Based upon the history of other "movements" that had failed, Gamaliel
reasons that if the apostles were doing the work of men, it would come
to naught.  But if it was the work of God, the council could do nothing
to stop it and would only be fighting against God.  The council is
willing to heed his advice, though the apostles are beaten and charged
not to speak in the name of Jesus before being released.  The apostles
leave the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer
shame in the name of Jesus, and continue right on teaching and preaching
Jesus as the Christ every day in the temple and in every house (<b>33-42</b>).
