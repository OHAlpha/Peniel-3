                             Chapter Three</b>

<b>OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS CHAPTER</b>

1) To study the healing of the lame man, noting various aspects of the
   miracle

2) To examine Peter's second gospel sermon, his call to repent and the
   blessings to follow

<b>SUMMARY</b>

The chapter opens with Peter and John going to the temple where they
encounter a man lame from birth begging for alms at the gate called
Beautiful.  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Peter commands him
to rise up and walk.  Taking the lame man by the right hand and lifting
him up, the man is healed instantly and completely.  Walking, leaping,
and praising God, he accompanies Peter and John into the temple to the
wonder and amazement of the crowd (<b>1-11</b>).

On Solomon's porch, Peter explains that the healing occurred by faith in
the name of Jesus.  God has glorified His Servant Jesus, the Holy One
and the Just, the Prince of life, whom they denied and killed, but whom
God raised from the dead as witnessed by Peter and John.  While their
crimes were done in ignorance, even foretold and fulfilled by God, they
are commanded to repent and turn.  Those that do are promised to have
their sins blotted out and experience other blessings from Jesus who
will remain in heaven until the times of restoration of all things.
Those who do not heed Jesus will be utterly destroyed as foretold by
Moses (cf. <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Deut%2018.15" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Deut 18.15" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Deut 18:15</a>,<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Deut%2018.18-19" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Deut 18.18-19" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">18-19</a></b>).  As sons of the prophets, and of the
covenant God made with Abraham to bless all families through his seed
(cf. <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Gen%2022.18" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Gen 22.18" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Gen 22:18</a></b>), to them first God has sent Jesus to bless them in
turning them away from their iniquities (<b>12-26</b>).
