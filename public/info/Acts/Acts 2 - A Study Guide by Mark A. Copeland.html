                              Chapter Two</b>

<b>OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS CHAPTER</b>

1) To carefully consider the events surrounding the outpouring of the
   Spirit on the day of Pentecost

2) To examine Peter's first gospel sermon, and the evidence presented in
   it for the resurrection of Jesus Christ

3) To observe the response to the sermon, and what people were told to
   do in order to be saved

4) To note the establishment and characteristics of the church in
   Jerusalem

<b>SUMMARY</b>

Ten days after Jesus ascended to heaven, on the Jewish feast day of
Pentecost, the Holy Spirit is poured out as promised.  With the sound of
a rushing mighty wind, and with tongues of fire appearing above their
heads, those filled with the Holy Spirit begin to speak in other tongues
(<b>1-4</b>).  Devout Jews visiting from other countries are attracted and
amazed as they hear wonderful works of God proclaimed in their own
languages (<b>5-13</b>).

Peter, standing with the rest of the apostles, explains that what has
happened is a fulfillment of Joel's prophecy (<b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Joel%202.28-32" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Joel 2.28-32" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Joel 2:28-32</a></b>), who
foretold that God would pour out His Spirit in the last days (<b>14-21</b>).
He then preaches Jesus of Nazareth to the crowd, reminding them of His
miracles, their involvement in His death, and proclaiming that God
raised Him from the dead.  As proof for the resurrection, Peter offers
three lines of evidence:  1) the prophecy by David, who foretold of the
resurrection (<b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ps%2016.8-11" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ps 16.8-11" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Ps 16:8-11</a></b>);  2) the twelve apostles as witnesses;  3)
the Spirit's outpouring itself , indicative of Christ's exaltation and
reception of the promise of the Spirit from the Father.  In conclusion,
Peter pronounces that God has made Jesus, whom they crucified, both Lord
and Christ (<b>22-36</b>).

Cut to the heart, the people ask the apostles what they should do.
Peter commands them to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins
and gift of the Holy Spirit.  With many other words he exhorts them to
be saved, and about 3000 souls gladly receive his word and are baptized
(<b>37-41</b>).

Thus begins the church in Jerusalem, which continues steadfastly in the
apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and prayers.
Signs and wonders are done by the apostles, while the believers display
their love and devotion through acts of benevolence and frequent
worship.  They enjoy the favor of the people, and the Lord adds to the
church daily those being saved (<b>42-47</b>).

         them to be drunk

   <b>B. THE FULFILLMENT OF JOEL'S PROPHECY (16-21)</b>
      1. The events were those prophesied by Joel (cf. <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Joel%202.28-32" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Joel 2.28-32" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Joel 2:28-32</a></b>)

         d. With salvation to those who call upon the name of the Lord

      2. Jesus, crucified and put to death
         a. According to the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God
         b. Which they did by lawless hands (via the Romans)
      3. Jesus, whom God raised from the dead
         a. Having loosed the pains of death

   <b>B. EVIDENCE:  THREEFOLD TESTIMONY (25-35)</b>

         b. David could not be speaking of himself
            1) For he was dead and buried
            2) With his tomb for all to see
         c. But spoke as a prophet
            1) He knew that God had sworn with an oath that one of his
               descendants would be raised to sit on his throne
            2) He therefore spoke of the resurrection of Christ, whose
               soul was not left in Hades nor did His flesh see

            2) Having received from the Father the promise of the Holy
               Spirit
         b. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but prophesied of
            the Lord (<b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ps%20110.1" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ps 110.1" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Ps 110:1</a></b>)
