                              Chapter Four</b>

<b>OBJECTIVES IN STUDYING THIS CHAPTER</b>

1) To study the beginning of the persecution against the church, and the
reason for it

2) To note the apostolic response to persecution, and continued progress
of the church in Jerusalem

<b>SUMMARY</b>

The first case of persecution against the church is described in this
chapter.  Peter and John are put into custody because their preaching on
the resurrection of Jesus disturbed a number of the religious leaders
(in particular the Sadducees who denied any resurrection, <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Mt%2022.23" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Mt 22.23" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Mt 22:23</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ac%2023.8" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ac 23.8" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Ac
23:8</a></b>).  In spite of this, the number of men who believed came to be
about five thousand (<b>1-4</b>).

After a night in jail, Peter and John are brought before the council,
including the high priest and members of his family.  Challenged to
explain themselves, Peter proclaims the healing was done by the name of
Jesus Christ, the very one they crucified yet whom God raised from the
dead and who has now become "the chief cornerstone" (cf. <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ps%20118.22" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ps 118.22" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Ps 118:22</a></b>),
and in whose name alone salvation is now available.  Amazed  at Peter
and John's boldness, and unable to deny that the lame man had been
healed, the council sends them outside and confer among themselves.
They decide to prevent the spread of the apostles' doctrine by
threatening Peter and John not to preach or teach in the name of Jesus.
The apostles respond that they must speak what they have seen and heard.
The council, unable to do anything more at this time because of the
people, simply threaten the apostles once again and let them go (<b>5-22</b>).

Returning to their companions, Peter and John report what has been said.
Prayer is offered, asking for boldness in view of the persecution
foretold in <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Psalms%202.1-2" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Psalms 2.1-2" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Psalms 2:1-2</a></b>, and for signs and wonders to continue in the
name of Jesus.  At the conclusion of the prayer, the place where they
prayed was shaken and all were filled the Holy Spirit, emboldening them
to speak the Word of God (<b>23-31</b>).

The chapter ends with a description of the continued growth of the
church, with the oneness of the brethren and the empowered testimony of
the apostles to the resurrection of Jesus.  The great liberality
continues, meeting the needs of the saints.  One example in particular
is noted, that of Barnabas, whose work is featured later in the book
(cf. <b><a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ac%2011.22-30" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ac 11.22-30" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">Ac 11:22-30</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/nkjv/Ac%2013.1-15.41" class="lbsBibleRef" data-reference="Ac 13.1-15.41" data-version="nkjv" target="_blank">13:1-15:41</a></b>), and whose liberality stands in stark
contrast to what takes place in the next chapter (<b>32-36</b>).
