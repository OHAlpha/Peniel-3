<h2>About Seventh-Day Adventists</h2>
<p>Adventists believe a Trinity of three persons - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - make up one God. They made salvation possible when Jesus, the Son, came to earth as a baby in Bethlehem and lived a sinless life in accordance with the Father's will. When Jesus was crucified for the sins of the people of the world and arose from the dead on the third day, victory was won for everyone.</p>
